# Classy Characters

In this program, I use a hierarchy of classes and the principle of inheritance to instantiate a `player` character and several enemies along with stats for each. Both versions do the same thing, but I defined inheritable class attributes in version 2 instead of repeatedly initializing instance attributes in every subclass.

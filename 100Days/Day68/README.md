# Guess Who 2.0

This is a direct extension of a GUI built on Day 68 using Python's `tkinter` module. It displays and hides images and error messages based on user input into the text box. The names that a user can pull images for are "Charlotte", "Gerald", "Katie", and "Mo".  

NOTE: I also updated the directory hierarchy to reduce redundancy.

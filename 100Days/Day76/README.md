# Flask Web Server

This was my first introduction to the Flask web server through Python. The challenge for today was to grab the HTML, CSS, and image files associated with the project portfolio I had created on Day 74 and the linktree that I had created on Day 75 and introduce generate an interlinked website through the Flask server.

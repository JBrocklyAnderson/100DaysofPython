# Automated Email

This program is designed to send an email to oneself with a daily inspirational quote. The quotes are stored in a text file ("quotes.txt") which is read into the script and a random quote is then selected each day to be emailed. The script utilizes the `schedule` library to automate the email sending process on a daily basis.

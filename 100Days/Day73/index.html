    <h2>A Journey Through the Lessons of Object-Oriented Programming</h2>
    <p>I graduated with a Bachelor's in Political Science and Mandarin Chinese. I never thought of myself as a web developer or software engineer, but I've been inspired by a personal hero to persistently challenge myself. To that end, I've been vigorously working through <a href="https://replit.com/@JosephBrockly-A">Repl.it's</a> <b>100 Days of Python</b>.
    </p>
    <p>Though I'm not quite finished, the journey has been incredibly rewarding. I've written working computer programs that solve real world problems and provide demonstrable use to people, from Mad Libs and Loan Calculators to interactive graphic novels and minigames. This website is dedicated to showcasing my journey through the challenge and how I learned to code in Python by exploring 5 particular days.

    <h1>Day 72</h1>
    <h2>A Cybersecure Journal Library</h2>
    <p> This program was one of my more recent projects and it involved a tremendous amount of thinking. I won't go into all of the various challenges—both big and small—that I encountered while building it, But I will mention that it incorporates an understanding and practice of appending salts to user passwords before hashing in order to keep the journal accounts more secure than would be possible if I had merely saved user passwords into a database.
    </p>
    <p> This cybersecure journal that allows any user who forks the Repl to create something like 50,000 separate journals—each with innumerable journal entries—is not 100% safe from professional hackers. Though there are multiple layers of security built into the program Through the use of hashing and salting passwords, it is still conceivable that someone with sufficiently advanced hacking methodologies could reverse engineer the user's password. This is extraordinarily unlikely, however; the salt appended to the end of the passwords inputted ranges from one to 999,999.
    </p>
    <p> This program was probably the most exciting for me to build because I had no prior experience with anything related to cyber security and the sheer technical prowess possible with computational technology ceases to amaze me. <a href="https://replit.com/@JosephBrockly-A">Repl.it</a>'s <b><i>100 Days of Python</i></b> challenge involves building quite a few different versions of login systems that ask users for their passwords and usernames. I, of course, never entered anything beyond extremely basic usernames and passwords because I did not want to jeopardize any actual security, but I perhaps naively believed that Repl.it itself took enough precaution to protect this information. This was all before I was learned about Repl.it's Secrets tool, the concept of forking a program, hashing, precomputation, rainbow tables, salting, and pepper values (a concept I thankfully stumbled across by accident). this area of computer programming is actually deeply fascinating because it represents the truest form of a dialectical cat and mouse game where whoever maintains one step ahead becomes the winner.

    <h1>Day 66</h1>
    <h2>A Simple Arithmetic Calculator</h2>
    <p> This simple calculator set within a graphical user interface was an incredibly challenging program to code. I had never before used to tkinter and object-oriented programming concepts but through the process of what seemed like endless trial and error, a feasible code emerged that emulated the basic functionality of a Window's 98 calculator, coming complete with all the basic arithmetic functions and a clear button to boot.
    </p>
    <p>I ended up running into a problem that emerged as the number grew beyond the invisible grid that kept the buttons in place. Namely, the button columns separated further as the number grew longer. A tried a variety of methods to fix this problem: I changed the font and sizing of the number, the width of the buttons, and more, but nothing stopped the unwanted behavior. Eventually, as I learn more about the intracies of Python and OOP, I may very well decide to change how I pack the buttons into the GUI window to overcome this aesthetically unappealing behavior.

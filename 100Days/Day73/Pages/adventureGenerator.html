    <h1>Day 4</h1>
    <h2>The Adventure Generator</h2>
    <p> This was one of the very first programs that I built in Repl.it that I began to think of myself as capable of learning how to program. I had programming experience in R and R Studio as a result of a capstone project I did to get professionally certified in Data Analytics, so I knew of the supposed "feud" between the two languages. My brother is an impressive programmer who prefers Python over R and his Python code, especially in this early phase of my learning, felt daunting to say the least.
    </p>
    <p>Fortunately, this challenge provided a way to build an interactive mad lib's style storytelling device. Even though it's relatively short (and full of oddly-placed spaces due to concatenating text strings and variables without using an f-string literal), I've been enamored with creative writing since my early childhood, so I immediately resonated. Needless to say, this is when I got hooked to learning Python. I knew it was going to be difficult, but I knew it would be immensely valuable, both personally and professionally. My mind had expanded just enough to continue and I'm grateful for putting in the work.

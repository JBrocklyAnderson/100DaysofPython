    <h1>Day 39</h1>
    <h2>The Event Horizon</h2>
    <p>By now, I had a solid grass and while-loops, for-loops, and if-else statements. I also had a little practice with subroutines, so I combined all of these basic principles and created a version of the children's word game "hangman". I thematically constructed the game around the concept of a spaceship mechanic needing to rescue the crew in a time of crisis. It was fun thinking of the narrative behind the game but quite challenging working out all the details.
    </p>
    <p> I had to display the word—randomly chosen from a laundry list of words using the random library—as a series of underscores so that players were not completely in the dark, not to mention keep track of guesses already made and separate them using the join function while decrementing variables to similate a dwindling window of time to save the spaceship. It took a long time to build but I stand by the final result. Around this time is when I became truly fascinated with the possibilities that programming and software engineering opened up for me.</p>

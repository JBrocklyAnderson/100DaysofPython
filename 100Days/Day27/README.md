This program forms the basis of the game that I built in Day 28. It prompts a user to create one or many characters (name and type), then uses randomization to set the characters' health and strength stats. It's less interactive than the project I built on Day 28, but it has a deeper narrative philosophy based on the stats that are ultimately assigned each character. The project was designed to explore how to use subroutines, while loops, and if-else statements more in-depth than before.

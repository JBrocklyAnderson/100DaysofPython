# Weather App

This program is a simple template for a comprehensive weather application using JSON data from a free weather API called Open Meteo. currently it displays the current date, the weather condition, and the maximum and minimum temperatures for Sacramento, CA. Eventually, I will add more functionality like the ability to see the 10-day forecast, set different locations, and more.

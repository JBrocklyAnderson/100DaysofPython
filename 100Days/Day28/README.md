This is a very simple game that allows two players to create their own characters and set them against each other in a battle to the death. It functions by randomly assigning each character a health and strength stat determined in a respective subroutine and then rolling a 6-sided die to determine which character wins the round being executed. Wheover loses the round, loses in health the difference between the character's strength stats. Each round is kept track of and the battle keeps going until one character's health reaches zero, at which point the loser receives a motivating message to play another game.

    <h1>Passionate Polymath: From Politics to Programming</h1>
  </div>
      <p> I am unconditionally fascinated by alll things: politics, language, philosophy, AI, astronomy, design, cybersecurity, architecture, biology, medicine, music, machinery, nature, you name it (in no particular order)! The best part about data science, computer programming, and software engineering is that these fields are capable of bringing together all of these disparate interests into a unified whole. The world is full of astonishing things to learn and I'm racing against the clock to explore it all in one life!</p>
      <p>I have extensive in-depth academic training about global interdependence and international relations, comprehensive certifications in data analysis, leadership, and cultural sensitivity, professional publications for academic dissertations, project portfolios showcasing my programming proclivities, deep multilingual capacities in Chinese, French, and Spanish, specialized public-facing customer service experience, an abundant long-standing passion for innovation, collaboration, and determination, and awards for academic excellence from University of California, Davis.</p>
  <p>A key challenge for society and business in the 21st century is bridging the gap between industries that have specialized so much but have neglected to learn from each other. Unfettering the combined productive force of the global economy will be the flowering of humanity. I aim to help those making that world possible.</p>

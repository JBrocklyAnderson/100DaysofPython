# Replit's Debugging Tool

The whole point of this exercise was to acquaint oneself with Replit's debugging tool in order to troubleshoot step-by-step a pre-built program designed to prompt the user for a number to check against a random value generated by the computer. The first problem found was that the number randomizer was placed within a while loop, which ensured that it would change every time a user guessed it. The second problem was in the type of data the menu input is versus what the `if` statement searches for.  

Both the original and debugged versions of the code are included in today's directory for comparison.

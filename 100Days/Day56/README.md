# Top Artists' Directory Hierarchization

This short program uses a CSV file of the top 100 songs in music to create a file directory hierarchy in which each folder is named after an artist on the list and is populated by text files name after their top songs ordered by global ranking. Because of the sheer volume of folders created, I have chosen not to include the directory in the repository.

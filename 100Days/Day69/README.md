# Mushroom Madness

This is a simple interactive graphic novel displayed within a GUI built using `tkinter` and `PIL`. 

WARNING: NEVER eat unidentified mushrooms. While deadly species are in the minority, they can look extremely similar to perfectly edible varieties and many others will make you sick. Words of advice: "there are old mushroom hunters and there are bold mushroom hunters, but there has never been an old, bold mushroom hunter." 

NOTE: This story is for pure amusement and does not in any way condone the consumption of unknown or hallucinogenic mushrooms.

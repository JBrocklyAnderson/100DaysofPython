# PredaDEX Entry

This program forms the basis for another day's challenge wherein a user creates, defines, and empowers a fictional predator for battle. It uses various dictionaries and for loops to store and print a single entry in a PredaDEX (kind of like a Pok√©DEX) color-coded based on predator type.

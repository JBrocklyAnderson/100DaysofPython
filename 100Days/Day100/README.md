# Insta 360 Price Scraper

This is a capstone project for Replit's 100 Days of Python Challenge. The program is designed to automate the tracking of a product's price on Insta360's photography website. It allows a user to input a product link and a price threshold they'd buy the product at, stores this data, and then periodically checks the product's price on the website. If the price drops below the specified threshold, it sends an email notification to the user urging them that "now is the perfect time to buy!" The program utilizes various libraries: 'requests' for HTTP requests, 'BeautifulSoup' from 'bs4' for scraping and parsing HTML, 'smtplib' for configuring accordance with the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, 'email.mime' for constructing and sending emails, 'logging' for logging events and errors during exception handling, 'schedule' for scheduling and running the price check, and 'replit.db' for data storage. The script is structured to run the price checking function daily, with a scheduler that keeps it running and checks for scheduled tasks every second (as opposed to as many times as possible at all times) to save CPU processing power.

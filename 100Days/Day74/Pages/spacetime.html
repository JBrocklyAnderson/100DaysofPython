    <h1>Day 17</h1>
    <h2>Spacetime!</h2>
    <p>This particular program was my first foray into the logic of while loops and if-else statements which I use in conjunction to advance an emulation of the children's game "Rock-Paper-Scissors" with 5 inputs instead of 3. It took quite a bit of thinking to encode every possible solution but the final result was definitely satisfying, especially when sharing it with my nephews and nieces.

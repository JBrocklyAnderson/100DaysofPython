This repository will contain 100 mini projects built using Python on Repl.it as a part of their "100 Days of Code Challenge." I began the challenge on August 25th, 12023. The projects are organized by the day they to be completed, but the repository is not completed yet. I fully expect to all of the projects to be done well before the 100-day mark (December 3rd, 12023). Since this repository is designed to track my progress learning Python, I have done my best NOT to go back and correct, expand upon, trim down, or in any way stylize the code from previous projects. This is my attempt to demonstrate the various elements of Python (and associated software engineering concepts like ANSI escape codes, etc.) that I've learned in a sequential order. This README file will be finalized upon completion of the challenge.

Some of these projects have been quite entertaining and useful. They inspired a few other project ideas, including expansions of the code found here, for which I will likely create separate repositories. I encourage anyone new to Python programming to check out Repl.it's tutorial section.

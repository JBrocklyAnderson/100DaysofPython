# Repl.it's 100 Days of Python Challenge

## Introduction
Welcome to the repository documenting the journey of an inspired programmer and data analyst through Replit's 100 Days of Python Challenge. I embarked on this adventure to further cement my passion and expertise in the world of software engineering, web development, computer programming, and data analysis. This repository showcases the culmination of hard work, dedication, and an insatiable thirst for knowledge.

## What's Inside?
Contained within are 97 Python projects ranging from easier to more advanced, each with its unique README file detailing the day's challenge, the concepts learned, and the solution approach. These projects encompass a broad spectrum of programming concepts and Python capabilities. Since this repository is designed to track my progress learning Python, I have done my best NOT to go back and correct, expand upon, trim down, or in any way stylize the code from previous projects. This is my attempt to demonstrate the various elements of Python (and associated software engineering concepts) that I've learned in a more-or-less sequential order.

## Topics Covered:
1. Basics of Python:
- Data Types: Strings, Integers, Floats, Booleans, Lists, Dictionaries, Tuples, & Sets

- Arithmetic, Assignment, Logical, & Relational Operators
- Documentation & Code Annotation
- Naming Conventions
- ANSII Escape Codes

2. Control Flow:
- For Loops
- While Loops
- Nested Loops
- Break and Continue Statements
- Recursive Subroutines

3. Functions & Modules:
- Function Definitions & Calls
- Parameters, Arguments, & Return Values
